# Li_CSCI2270_FinalProject
#Project Summary
I am going to work alone for the final project. In this project, I am going to extend HW6and7 assignments and add more public methods functions. My final project will read in a txt file by using command line. The txt file will include a list of movies with release years, ranking, movie name and amount of stock. Once I read in those info, I will put those into my binary search tree nodes. Then my LiProject.cpp file will include a display menu with 10 options. Those options will include some searching tools(base on name, year, ranking), display the movie list, delete a movie from the list, rent/return mvoies, count the total amount of movies and quit. 

#How to Run
Firstly download the zip file provided. Secondly using Code:Blocks or any smiliar app to run the cpp file. Then it will display a menu with 10 options user can choose. Once the user choose those options, user will follow the questions and type info. Finally, the matching result will be displayed.
