# Li_CSCI2270_FinalProject
#Project Summary
I am going to work alone for the final project. In this project, I am going to extend HW6and7 assignments and add more public methods functions. My final project contains 10 public method. The code will read in a txt file by using command line. The txt file includes a list of movies with release years, ranking, movie name, amount of stock and movie director. Once I run the code, it will put those information into my binary search tree nodes. Then my LiProject.cpp file display a  menu with 10 options. Those options will include some searching tools(base on name or ranking), display the movie list or movie directors, delete/add a movie from the list, rent/return mvoies, count the total amount of movies and quit. 

#How to Run
Firstly download the zip file: FinalProject_Update.zip provided. Secondly using Code:Blocks. Once the code run, it display a menu with 10 options to let user choose. Once the user choose, user will need follow the questions and type info. Finally, the matching result will be displayed.

#Dependencies
This code will need a txt file which contains:ranking, movie title, release year, quantity in stock, director. The txt file is provided in the zip file. Once the user download the zip file and leave the txt file in the same location, the code will work fine.

#System	Requirements
Either Windows or Mac will work. As long as you have a tool can open cbp files that running c++ code ( suggest: Code:Block).
